# DeepFake_detection

This project focuses on developing a deep learning model to identify deepfake images, specifically targeting manipulated face images from https://www.thispersondoesnotexist.com/. Utilizing TensorFlow and the Xception/VGG19 architecture pre-trained on ImageNet, the model has been trained to distinguish between 'real' and 'fake' images. The model benefits from enhancements like image preprocessing, data augmentation, and performance tuning with a focus on improving the accuracy and robustness against deepfake technologies.

User interface was developed with Streamlit.
